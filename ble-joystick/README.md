# ble-joystick
This is a rust project example to demonstate and learn BLE joystick. This project uses the [micro:bit v2](https://microbit.org) and the [joystick:bit](https://wiki.elecfreaks.com/en/microbit/expansion-board/joystick-bit-v2/). The basic functionality was produced using generative AI to be developed futher as a learning experinece.
